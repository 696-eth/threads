This @ultrasoundmoney 🦇🔊 talk from #devcon 6 by Justin Drake is a 𝐌𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐖𝐀𝐓𝐂𝐇 - here it's in a text format 👇 

Speaker(s): @drakefjustin 

Skill Level: Beginner

Track: Cryptoeconomics

Keywords: $ETH , $ether , economics

A big picture for ETH the asset and its macro cashflows. 

Discussed unique dynamics arising from:

💨 fee burn🔥 (Ξ for🚗 blockspace payments)

🖨️ issuance (Ξ for validator incentivization)

🥩 staking (Ξ for economic security 🔒 )

🧊 collateral -defi (Ξ for economic bandwidth🪙)

Ether (asset) is a critical part of Ethereum (internet settlement).

No Ether => No Ethereum

ETH - internet money 

ETH and Ethereum are interconnected

🌡️ Temperature of money - velocity.

Think of Money as Water

Spectrum of:

・Solid 🧊 

・Liquid 💧

・Gas 💨

Usages:                                               

🥩Staking = freezing Liquidity  

💨Fees = 🔥burning Liquidity

Layer 2

🧊Collateral = through bonding of Liquidity🪙

💦Currency = transacting🔁

💦Currency = comes from word 'current' = money that's moving

Usually people think of 'money' => current => high velocity use cases

Need to focus on LOW velocity use cases too: using ETH as a collateral is a use of money!

💧Liquid ETH - as programmable money can be:

2️⃣ Economies:

❄️ Cold economy:🥩Staked => Security 🔒 + 🧊 Application layer => Economic Bandwidth🪙

♨️ HOT economy:💨Spent =>🔥Base fees => ♻️Sustainability + 🔁Transacting => Economic Activity of Currency💦

Looking closer into each one 👇 

🔒Security

Security ratio = Total Value Secured (TVS) / economic security

= value secured by Ethereum / valuing securing Ethereum 🥩

The lower Security Ratio the better

Current Security ratio is 19x with $390T as TVL with the following distribution:

・ETH - $162B 

・ERC20s - $189B

・NFTs - $23B

$2️0B of economic security. Good or Bad?

Most secure blockchain! 2x of #bitcoin

ENDGAME: Trillions of $ of economic security

🔒Security comes from 🥩staking - ETH deposits

🖨️Issuances incentivizes people to Stake 🥩

Staking has 2 parts:

❄️Cold - freezing by staking 🥩

♨️Hot - issuing ETH for validators 🖨️ 

![](https://i.imgur.com/T4jGT6X.png)

/11
                                              
🌾Yield from issuance🖨️: 

🥩ETH increases by 4x - Yield goes down by 2x🌾:

・4M ETH staked = 8% Yield

・16M ETH = 4%

🌾Yield and 🖨️ issuance together create a natural 🥩 stake equilibrium

![](https://i.imgur.com/HnTlcQ9.png)

/12 
                                              
Equilibrium may be reached at ~2x ETH staked🥩

But Ether appreciating (x25) gets to trillions of $ staked🥩= 

That's why ETH price is important.

/13   
                                              
Minimizing the cost of security.

Issuance dilutes the holders.

After the Merge the issuance has gone down by more than 20x compared to genesis =>

Optimal issuance = relatively small issuance => ossification 

Now it's very clear that ETH is critical to Ethereum's security 🔒

/14                                              

♻️ Sustainability

Assessing Ethereum as a *hypothetical* company. 

Profits = income - expenses

income = blockspace sales

expenses = security budget

Profits = blockspace sales - security budget

or in other words

Profits = 🔥burn - issuance 🖨️

We can look at PE ratios on @ultrasoundmoney

/15                                              

Supply since the Merge +0.01%/y AND we are in a bear market.

Zooming out, we are likely to burn more than 1%/y
=> Negative supply growth  

Eventually, supply will find a new equilibrium.

🔒Security of Ethereum is ♻️ sustainable because of 💨 fees spent and 🔥 burned ? 

What about Economic Bandwidth 🪙 ?

Application layer:

🧊Ξ used in DEFI.

・@MakerDAO uses 1.4M Ξ as collateral for decentralized stablecoin

・@AaveAave uses 0.5M Ξ for decentralized loans

/18                                              

ETH is a pristine collateral🧊:

✅No contract risk

✅No custodial risk

✅No oracle risk

✅No bridge risk

✅No governance risk

❌ volatility

To stabilize $ETH =>🏦decentralized stablecoins that are backed by Ether.

🪙Current Economical Bandwidth used for that would be 2M Ξ

![](https://i.imgur.com/9tJW695.png)
/19                                              

ΞETH is the perfect collateral money🧊  

Importance of $ETH price

$1B in decentralized stablecoins baked by ETH

We need Trillions.

Grow collateral by 15x.

But then then ETH price has to grow for us to reach trillions.

/20                                              

Illiquidity multiplier: 

Cashflows happen within the Liquid part 💧

🔥Burn + Issuance🖨️are Liquid💧

ETH market cap = [mcap of 💧] x [1 /💧%]

[ 1 /💧%] today = 1.25x

in 10 years? might be 5x => mcap of ETH x4!

🔁Activity needs Scaling🌊 

𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙎𝙪𝙧𝙜𝙚 𝙞𝙨 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙜!

100x transactions per each:

・rollups

・sharding

・Nielsen's law (Moore's law for 🪙Bandwidth) 

🪙Bandwidth is the only resource that is needed for blockchains to consume

/22                                              

🦇 🔊 🚧Ultra sound barrier:

How much does each TX need to Pay for Ethereum to be sustainable? 

♻️ Sustainability = 💵 enough income to pay for 🔒 

With 🌊Scalability: 1million x transactions => 3gwei/tx ♻️

/23                                              

🚗Blockspace is a big business  

Daily blockspace sales have been growing

Induced demand:
Unlocks more activity🔁
=> more blockspace🚗
=>🚗blockspace gets cheaper 
=> attracting more demand for blockspace🚗

/24                                              
                                              
Big picture summary:

💧Total Supply - 100M ETH:

🔒Security = 33M

🥩🖨️Issuance from stake Ether => 1M Ξ/y

🔥Burn => 1M Ξ/y

💵Income $1Bs/day from selling 🚗blockspace

🌊Scalability in play => tiny tx fees ✖️ many transactions / second => 💵𝘏𝘶𝘨𝘦 Income => Security 🔒

![](https://i.imgur.com/dCw9p7e.png)

💦Currency - 33M ETH

🏦Stablecoins - $10Ts

🧊Collateral - 33M ETH

🪙Bandwidth - $10Ts

Potential future where Ethereum has succeeded in becoming the settlement layer for the internet of value! 

/26                                              

Bonus:

Q:

A: LSD allow to get the priveleage of unstaking immediately while paying a small fee to Marketmakers, thus market makers unstaking some ETH but someone else would come in with ETH to stake because of equilibrium. 
Total # of E = illiquid iceberg
cant melt cause melting a part creates another ice on the other side

same as induced demand
