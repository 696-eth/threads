This @ultrasoundmoney 🦇🔊 talk from #devcon 6 by Justin Drake is a 𝐌𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐖𝐀𝐓𝐂𝐇 - here it's in a text format 👇 

Speaker(s): @drakefjustin 

Skill Level: Beginner

Track: Cryptoeconomics

Keywords: $ETH , $ether , economics

A big picture for ETH the asset and its macro cashflows. 

Discussed unique dynamics arising from:

💨 fee burn🔥 (Ξ for🚗 blockspace payments)

🖨️ issuance (Ξ for validator incentivization)

🥩 staking (Ξ for economic security 🔒 )

🧊 collateral -defi (Ξ for economic bandwidth🪙)

Ether (asset) is a critical part of Ethereum (internet settlement).

No Ether => No Ethereum

ETH - internet money 

ETH and Ethereum are interconnected

🌡️ Temperature of money - velocity.

Think of Money as Water

Spectrum of:

・Solid 🧊 

・Liquid 💧

・Gas 💨

Usages:                                               

🥩Staking = freezing Liquidity  

💨Fees = 🔥burning Liquidity

Layer 2

🧊Collateral = through bonding of Liquidity🪙

💦Currency = transacting🔁

💦Currency = comes from word 'current' = money that's moving

Usually people think of 'money' => current => high velocity use cases

Need to focus on LOW velocity use cases too: using ETH as a collateral is a use of money!

💧Liquid ETH - as programmable money can be:

2️⃣ Economies:

❄️ Cold economy:🥩Staked => Security 🔒 + 🧊 Application layer => Economic Bandwidth🪙

♨️ HOT economy:💨Spent =>🔥Base fees => ♻️Sustainability, Economic Security + 🔁Transacting => Economic Activity💦

Looking closer into each one 👇 

🔒Security

Security ratio = Total Value Secured (TVS) / economic security

= value secured by Ethereum / valuing securing Ethereum 🥩

The lower Security Ratio the better

Current Security ratio is 19x with $390T as TVL with the following distribution:

・ETH - $162B 

・ERC20s - $189B

・NFTs - $23B

$2️0B of economic security. Good or Bad? 🤔 

🔒Most secure blockchain! 2x of #bitcoin

📈ENDGAME: Trillions of $ of economic security

🔒Security comes from 🥩staking - ETH deposits

🖨️Issuances incentivizes people to Stake 🥩

Staking has 2 parts:

❄️Cold - freezing by staking 🥩

♨️Hot - issuing ETH for validators 🖨️ 

![](https://i.imgur.com/T4jGT6X.png)

/11
                                              
🌾Yield from issuance🖨️: 

🥩ETH increases by 4x - Yield goes down by 2x:

・4M ETH staked = 8% Yield

・16M ETH = 4%

![](https://i.imgur.com/HnTlcQ9.png)

/12 
                                              
Equilibrium between🌾Yield and Issuance🖨️And Importance of $ETH price.

To get to Trillions of $ we need more ETH staked (2x) and price needs to go up (25x)

Minimizing the cost of security.

Issuance dilutes the holders.

After the Merge the issuance has gone down by more than 20x compared to genesis =>

Optimal issuance = relatively small issuance => ossification 

Now it's very clear that ETH is critical to Ethereum's security 🔒

/14                                              

♻️ Sustainability

Ethereum as a company. 

Profits = income - expenses

income = blockspace sales

expenses = security budget

Profits = blockspace sales - security budget

or in other words

Profits = 🔥burn - issuance 🖨️

We can look at PE ratios on @ultrasoundmoney

/15                                              

Supply since the Merge +0.01%/y and we are in a bear market.

if we zoom out. 

We are probably going to burn more than 1%/y
=> Negative supply growth  

Eventually supply will find a new equilibrium.

Ethereum needs security 🔒 

It would be sustainable cause of fees collected and gas burned 

What about Economic Bandwidth 🪙 ?

Application layer:

Ξ used in DEFI.

・@MakerDAO uses 1.4M Ξ as collateral for decentralized stablecoin

・@AaveAave uses 0.5M Ξ for decentralized loans

/18                                              

ETH is a pristine collateral🧊:

✅No contract risk

✅No custodial risk

✅No oracle risk

✅No bridge risk

✅No governance risk

❌ volatility

To stabilize $ETH =>🏦decentralized stablecoins that are baked by Ether.

🪙Current Economical Bandwidth used for that would be 2M Ξ

/19                                              

ΞETH is the perfect collateral money🧊  

Importance of $ETH price

$1B in decentralized stablecoins baked by ETH

We need Trillions.

Grow collateral by 15x.

But then then ETH price has to grow for us to reach trillions.

/20                                              

Illiquidity multiplier: 

Cashflows happen within the Liquid part 💧

🔥Burn + Issuance🖨️are Liquid💧

ETH market cap = [mcap of 💧] x [1 /💧%]

[ 1 /💧%] today = 1.25x

in 10 years? might be 5x => mcap of ETH x4!

How much each TX needs to Pay for Ethereum to be sustainable♻️? 

♻️ Sustainability = 💵 enough income to pay for 🔒 

With 🌊Scalability: 1million x transactions => 3gwei/tx ♻️

🔒🚗Blockspace is a big business 💰  

Daily🚗blockspace sales have been growing 📈

Induced demand: more 🚗blockspace => 🚗blockspace gets cheaper => attracting more demand 📈 

Thus, it is going to unlock more activity🔁

Big picture summary:

💧Total Supply - 100M ETH:

🔒Security = 33M

🥩🖨️Issuance from stake Ether => 1M/y

🔥Burn => 1M/y

💵Income $1Bs/day from selling 🚗blockspace

🌊Scalability in play => tiny tx fees ✖️ many transactions / second => 💵𝘏𝘶𝘨𝘦 Income => Security 🔒

💦Currency - 33M ETH

🏦Stablecoins - $10Ts

🧊Collateral - 33M ETH

🪙Bandwidth - $10Ts

Potential future where Ethereum has succeeded in becoming the settlement layer for the intent of value!
